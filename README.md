# Overview
Welcome to Space Walk! This project is a work in progress aimed at exploring celestial bodies using Python and Jupyter notebooks. We utilize SpiceyPy, which is a Python wrapper for the SPICE toolkit, providing access to various space mission data and functionalities.

# Requirements
To run this program, you need the following:

Python (version 3.12 or higher)

Jupyter Notebook

SpiceyPy library

Numpy

Scipy

Matplotlib



# Installations
Install Jupyter Notebook using pip install jupyter.

Install SpiceyPy by following the instructions on SpiceyPy GitHub.

Install Numpy using pip install numpy.

Install Scipy using pip install scipy.

Install Matplotlib using pip install matplotlib.

# Usage
Follow the instructions and code samples in the Jupyter notebook to interact with SpiceyPy and perform space-related calculations and simulations.
Experiment with different SPICE kernels and data to analyze and visualize celestial phenomena.
Refer to SpiceyPy documentation and SPICE toolkit documentation for advanced usage and functionalities.
